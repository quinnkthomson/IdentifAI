IdentifAI - An AI-based dorm security system built from a raspberry pi hosted on a web application:

Our software will use a raspberry pi set up with a camera to act as a dorm security camera. Our software will include a basic computer vision model that will identify different roommates, 
as well as unexpected visitors. Live updates will be accessed on a web application, provided allowed users authenticate.
